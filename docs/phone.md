# Periodic Phone Wipe Notes

I got into the habit of wiping my phone every 6 months (takes about an hour) in order to:

- Streamline the process
- Validate the backups
- Re-examine which apps should stay
- Remove leftover data
- Figure out the pains and find alternatives

My phone is a Pixel 8 with [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/), it has an [always-on VPN](/hub/), and a lot of self-hosting related apps.
